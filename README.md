# Irixium
Irixium is a GTK3/4 theme based off of the SGI IRIX Desktop, meant to comlpement the QT based themes of the same names in KDE Plasma [here](https://www.pling.com/p/1457753), though I'm not sure if it can be used outside of this scope.

This theme uses the repository by sylphenix as a codebase though I have implemented my own assets to be similar.

## Still A WIP
There are still some things that are not implement or not implemented fully but since I use the theme myself, be sure that there will be updates.
